# RIPTA bus tracker
Unofficial bus tracker for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority. This app is self-contained -- all code is in a single file. There are no JavaScript frameworks or other files required, other than the two bus images (SVGs, indigo with a white bus for "inbound", and green with a black bus for "outbound").

It requires data files -- for my project, I download and use the [files provided by TransitFeeds.com](https://transitfeeds.com/p/rhode-island-public-transit-authority/363). These change regularly, so if something breaks, the first thing to do is update those files.

To use this app, you will need a web server that runs PHP 5.2.1 (for json_decode) or higher. You will have to add your own API key (mine only works on my server), and you may want to add your own Google Analytics code.
