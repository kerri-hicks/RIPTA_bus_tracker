# RIPTA bus tracker
Unofficial bus tracker for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority. This app is self-contained -- all code is in a single file. There are no JavaScript frameworks or other files required, other than the two bus images (SVGs, indigo for "inbound", and green for "outbound").

This software is distributed under a [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 US](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/) license.

To use this app, you will need a web server that runs PHP 5.2.1 (for json_decode) or higher. You will have to add your own API key (mine only works on my server), and you may want to add your own Google Analytics code.
